Kue based job subscriber(consumer and workers pool) for sails. Its a wrapper around [Kue](https://github.com/learnboost/kue) for processing published jobs by using [redis](https://github.com/antirez/redis) as a queue engine.

*Note: This requires Sails v0.11.0+.  If v0.11.0+ isn't published to NPM yet, you'll need to install it via Github.*

## Installation
```js
$ npm install --save sails-hook-subscriber
```

## Usage
In the `api/workers` directory create your `worker definitions` based on `job type` the `worker` will have to process(perform). Example, a worker for `job type` email will be defined in the file `api/workers/EmailWorker.js`. The worker definition must define `perform function` which accept `job` to process ,`done` a callback to be called once job processing is done and `context` which is the [worker context](https://github.com/learnboost/kue#pause-processing). A `work definition` must also specify `concurrency` attribute wich will controll the [concurrency](https://github.com/learnboost/kue#processing-concurrency) of jobs it process. A sample `worker definition` is as below:

```js
//in api/workers/EmailWorker.js
/**
 * @description a worker to perform `email` job type
 * @type {Object}
 */
var async = require('async');
module.exports = {
    //specify worker
    //job concurrency
    concurrency: 2,

    //perform sending email
    //job
    perform: function(job, done, context) {
        var email = job.data.to;

        //send email

        //update sails model
        async
            .waterfall(
                [
                    function(next) {
                        //send email codes here
                        next(null, {
                            sentAt: new Date(),
                            status: 'Ok'
                        });
                    },
                    function(deliveryStatus, next) {
                        User
                            .findOneByEmail(email)
                            .exec(function(error, user) {
                                if (error) {
                                    next(error);
                                } else {
                                    user.emailSentAt = deliveryStatus.sentAt
                                    next(null, user, deliveryStatus);
                                }
                            });
                    },
                    function(user, deliveryStatus, next) {
                        user.save(function(error, user) {
                            if (error) {
                                next(error);
                            } else {
                                next(null, user, deliveryStatus);
                            }
                        });
                    }
                ],
                function(error, user, deliveryStatus) {
                    if (error) {
                        done(error);
                    } else {
                        done(null, deliveryStatus);
                    }
                });
    }

};
``` 
Thats all you are supposed to do and `sails-hook-subscriber` will do the heavy lifting to setup `kue` and use  `workers` to proess jobs whenever they are available in the `queue`.
